## Data Models

### User

  The `User` class represents the user entity in the application, encapsulating the following attributes:

  - **id**: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
  - **name**: User's name (String, 80 characters, unique, not nullable).
  - **password**: User's password (String, 255 characters, not nullable).
  - **email**: User's email address (String, 120 characters, unique, not nullable).
  - **email_alert**: Boolean indicating whether email alerts are enabled (Default: False).

### Event

  The `Event` class represents scheduled events associated with a user, featuring the following attributes:

  - **id**: Unique identifier for each event (Primary Key).
  - **task_name**: Name of the task or event (String, not nullable).
  - **date**: Date of the event (Date, not nullable).
  - **time**: Time of the event (Time, not nullable).
  - **duration**: Duration of the event in minutes (Integer, not nullable).  
  - **notes**: Additional notes for the event (Text).
  - **completed**: Integer indicating completion status (Default: 0).
  - **priority**: Integer indicating priority level (Default: 5).
  - **user_id**: Foreign key linking the event to a specific user.

  These data models provide a structured representation of user information and scheduled events within the application. The `User` model captures essential user details, while the `Event` model allows for the management of scheduled tasks associated with a user. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and database design considerations.

## Forms

## Future Scope & Reference
  1. This can be further added with many features by integrating with the calendar directly on the system so that we can get a calendar remainder always..
  2. Implementing an AI generated Task Scheduling Algorithm which can schedule the tasks by user priority and User can select from the options or he may do it manually..
